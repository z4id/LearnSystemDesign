### Design Patterns vs Design Principles
> Design Principles are general guidelines that can guide your class structure and relationships. On the other hand, Design Patterns are proven solutions that solve commonly reoccurring problems.

### Design Principles
- SOLID - The First 5 Principles of Object-Oriented Design
	> "To create understandable, readable, and testable code that many developers can collaboratively work on." 

- Single Responibility Principle
	a class should do one thing and therefore it should have only a single reason to change
- Open Closed Principle
	classes should be open for extension and closed to modification
- Liskov Subsitution Principle
	subclasses should be substitutable for their base/parent classes.
- Interface Segregation Principle
	many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface. Clients should not be forced to implement a function they don't need.
- Dependency Inversion Principle
	classes should depend upon interfaces or abstract classes instead of concrete classes and functions.

- DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself)
- KISS (Keep it simple, Stupid!)
- YAGNI (You ain't gonna need it)

- Strategy
